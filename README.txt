System Run On: cslinux1
Language used: C++
Compiler used: g++

1. Source Code: Unzip the zip archive- It will unzip contents in a NWRoutingSimulator folder.
	The folder contains the following:
	a. source files
	b. makefile - contains commands to compile source and generate controller and node executables
	c. topology.cfg - contains topology info (While making changes, please make them using unix)
	d. message folder: contains ALL messages(Input/Output) files generated by the program
	
	Please DO NOT CHANGE DIRECTORY structure of these files. Messages are and generated from messages folder. Executable is generated in the same folder as makefile and topology file. 

2. Compiling the code:
	a. Execute command: 
		make clean 
			- This cleans the previous messages and executables. If you just want to delete messages from previous runs, manually delete the contents of messages folder
	b. Execute command: 
		make
			- This COMPILES the source code and generates controller and node executables
	
3. Running the program
	a. Modify the topology.cfg file as per requirements
	b. Create/Modify the scenario.sh file and add/update commands to create controller or node with specific parameters
	c. Execute command:
		sh scenario.sh
	d. If you want to run a node separately after running the script mentioned above execute command:
		./node id <arguments> & eg: ./node 1 sender "this is a node 1 mcast msg" &

NOTES:
1. Ignore the warning messages displayed on console on executing the "make" command :)
2. Please ignore the console output messages of the program. Its hard to understand what is printed but as long as it is being printed the program is running fine.
